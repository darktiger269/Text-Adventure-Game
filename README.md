# Text Based Adventure Game

This is one of the final projects for my Python class. It revolves around the storyline of a dragon themed text-based adventure game. 

## Game Commands
"go North" , "go South" , "go East" , "go West"

**For obtaining items, you simply type:** "get **Item Name**" and it will add it to your inventory.
